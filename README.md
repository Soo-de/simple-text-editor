# simple-text-editor
This project is a basic text editor similar to Microsoft Word, aimed at reinforcing Windows Forms usage. It features a simple interface with options to save text, change colors, fonts, and sizes, as well as copy, paste, and cut functions. Text is saved in .txt files, and users can also load saved files.

## Notes
This project was developed as the first assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course in the second semester of my 1st year at Sakarya University.
